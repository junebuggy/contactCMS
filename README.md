This is a Backend Project to manage Contacts using APIs

Contacts have a first and last name, email addresses, and phone numbers.
The email and phone number have the ability to be marked as primary.
On Creation, the first email and phone number are marked default as primary.


The project takes account of preventing duplications.

This project is restricted in just using a single table.
So the fields for email and phone are in json to store multiple
email and phone records to the field.

The project can create / update a Contact, create / update / delete emails and phone numbers,
and merge two contacts.
